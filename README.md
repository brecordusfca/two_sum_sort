# two_sum_sort
You will first have to initilize the size of the array by inputing the number of possible numbers in the array and hitting enter.
Then you will then enter a loop where you will input each number and hit enter.
Once you are finished entering the numbers you will have to input your target sum and hit enter.
The program will then run the two_sum_sorting function where it will determine if the target sum is avalible.
If it is it will output the two numbers that create the target sum.
Otherwise it will say there is no solution and exit.
